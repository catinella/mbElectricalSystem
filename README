Description:
	This project (MBES) aims to realize a generic motorbike electric system you can use on any old motorbike.
	The system manages the following devices:
		- High light and down light
		- Left and right turn indicators
		- Additional (high power) light
		- Horn
		- Neutral, left/right indicators, high/down light... LEDs
		- STOP light
		- Engine start button
		- Motorbike (and engine) OFF switch
		- Decompressor

	The system provides the following services:
		- 5V generator for USB devices
		- Square electric wave for blinking light
		- Resistors key locker

	This release is based on MCU ATmega16L chip. It allowed me to add the resistors key management and keep the PCB size small
	enough. Also about the total price, it looks like a good solution. In fact the MCU costs 20$ (more or less) but the resistors
	key locker (git@github.com:catinella/rKey.git) device costs 30$-40$.

	Fuses and electric protections:
		The old motorbikes (like my DR-Big) have just one single fuse to protect the battery by short-circuits. It can be a
		disturbing trouble when you have multiple electric problems and/or you can continue without that particular service
		(eg. turn signals). It can happen in critical situation when you fording a river, or after you fall down in the middle
		of nowhere.
		MBES allows you to use upo to 5 fuses, almost one for service. It means, if you get falldown and you get horn damage
		and it make a short-circuit event, then you can continue without stop your motorbike.
		The resistors-key is protected by "unintentional" short-circuits
